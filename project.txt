//location and time based information gathering

Survey several physical, mental, or social characteristics of various individuals.
Ex:
	y = measure annual income 
	vs. x = age and years of formal schooling of a number of people.
	
My project:
	y = (analyze a user?)
		favorite count?
	x = 
		# per tweet
		@ per tweet
	then use new tweets as point estimators for a user?
	
	factors: 
		by user
			# per tweet (avg. per user)
			@ per tweet
			average tweet retweet time per time of day (estimate of time spent on twitter)
			common tweet time
			followers - popularity
			follows - connections
			tweet content (key words for a user?)
			twitter app (Web, Android, Iphone, Ipad) %use?
			language (en)
			% reply to users? - percent of tweets that are replying to other users
			verified?
			geolocation?
			utc offset - approximate location
			status count - user posts
				status rate (status count / time on twitter)
			friends count - user friends with others
			description content (key words?)
			favorites count - user favorites others
		by tweet
			# per tweet (point estimator for user)
			@ per tweet (point estimator for user)
			retweet time (point estimator) no retweet = skip
			favorite count
			tweet content (key words among all tweets?)
			twitter app of choice
			utc offset
			

Select an appropriate population of individuals, 
 - sample from the population
 - measure the characteristics
 - and use some variables to predict one of the variables
