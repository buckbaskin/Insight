# Insight Web App

I'm building a web app, where I loosely followed this [tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) to create a user facing for Insight analytics.

I'm now moving on to building in my Twitter analytics, for which I found a [tutorial](https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/) that implements basic word processing with NLTK and others.

It's going to be using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), the Python microframework.

### to launch app:
sudo python web_app/app/server.py
