# Insight Web App

I'm building a web app, where I loosely followed this [tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) to create a user facing for Insight analytics.

I'm now moving on to building in my Twitter analytics, for which I found a [tutorial](https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/) that implements basic word processing with NLTK and others. The tutorial was useful because it covered integrating NLTK, Redis task queues and AngularJS. It also guided me in moving my database from SQLite to PostgreSQL.

It uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), the Python microframework.

### to launch app:
python web_app/scripts/manage.py runserver
